# Muscle-Rehabilitation-Program
Simulation Program for Muscle Rehabilitation

# Developed for Arduino Uno Launchpad.
# Quick Simulation for patients undergoing Muscle Rehabilitation.
# Patients will be connected to Electromyographic Sensors compatible with Arduino Uno Board.
  While the program is running, a real time reading of the EMG signal will be visbile graphically
  on screen.
# Simulation Tests for 3 Separate Modes of Muscular Activity:
  # 1 - Contraction Duration
  # 2 - Magnitude of Contractions
  # 3 - Reaction time of Contractions.
